## Integration with Portals NFTs

Resonance is excited to announce our partnership with Portals, a prominent browser-based metaverse platform, to introduce an innovative feature that enhances the player experience within the Resonance Universe. Through this collaboration, we are creating a specialized template exclusively for the Resonance Universe within the Portals ecosystem.

### Genesis Pods NFTs

These unique NFTs, known as "Genesis Pods," grant Resonance players exceptional building capabilities within the Portals universe. Players can acquire a Genesis Pod, and select the Resonance Template, allowing them to purchase and personalize a home in Veilbrook, a central location within the game world. These homes serve as a canvas for players to unleash their creativity, as they can decorate and furnish their living spaces with assets acquired through in-game activities, such as shopping at various stores or winning prizes.

### Customizing Your Game Experience

The introduction of Resonance Genesis Pods offers players an unparalleled opportunity to customize and personalize their gaming experience. These virtual homes become a reflection of the player's style and preferences, fostering a deeper connection to the Resonance Universe.

### Royalties and Symbiosis

To further strengthen the collaborative spirit of this partnership, a portion of the royalties generated from Portals NFTs, specifically 1%, will be allocated to the ResonanceDAO Treasury. This arrangement fosters a symbiotic relationship between the Portals community and the Resonance community, both benefiting from each other's growth.

This collaboration exemplifies Resonance's commitment to innovation and enhancing player engagement by providing unique and immersive experiences within the gaming ecosystem.
