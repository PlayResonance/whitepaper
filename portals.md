## Integration with Portals NFTs

The entire Resonance Universe is meticulously crafted within the Portals ecosystem, offering players an immersive and interconnected experience like never before. Within this universe, players will encounter a myriad of mini-games, stores, staking platforms, and various other protocols seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the game. These elements come together to create a rich and diverse gaming experience that seamlessly blends open-world exploration, intricate puzzle-solving, and unique play-to-earn opportunities.

### Genesis Pods NFTs

These unique NFTs, known as "Genesis Pods," grant Resonance players exceptional building capabilities within the Portals universe. Players can equip a Genesis Pod with a custom Resonance template, allowing them to purchase and personalize a home in Veilbrook, a central location within the game world. These homes serve as a canvas for players to unleash their creativity, as they can decorate and furnish their living spaces with assets acquired through in-game activities such as shopping at various stores, or winning prizes.

### Customizing Your Game Experience

The introduction of Genesis Pods offers Resonance players an unparalleled opportunity to customize and personalize their gaming experience. These virtual homes become a reflection of the player's style and preferences, fostering a deeper connection to the Resonance Universe. Players can visit one another's spaces seemlessly, creating a community within the game itself.

### Royalties and Symbiosis

To further strengthen the collaborative spirit of this partnership, a portion of the royalties generated from Portals NFTs, specifically 1%, will be allocated to the ResonanceDAO Treasury. This arrangement fosters a symbiotic relationship between the Portals community and the Resonance community, both benefiting from each other's growth.

This collaboration exemplifies Resonance's commitment to innovation and enhancing player engagement by providing unique and immersive experiences within the gaming ecosystem.
