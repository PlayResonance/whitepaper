## Project TLDR

[Resonance](https://playresonance.com/) is an extraordinary open-world metaverse puzzle RPG, intricately crafted on [Portals](https://theportal.to/).

Within this immersive world, AI NPCs will further enrich the player's journey, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving environment that responds to their actions and choices. What's even more exciting is the potential to create collectible assets that hold real-world value and are tradable on secondary markets, all while ensuring creators receive their well-deserved royalties. This seamless, friction-free environment is poised to spark a gaming and open-source renaissance, ushering in a new era of innovation.

At Resonance, we're dedicated to empowering our community members to fully embrace these game-changing tools and Solana's unique play-to-earn mechanics, fostering dynamic relationships between businesses and the community that drive mutual success.

The tools we're crafting for Resonance hold a unique promise. These open-source mechanisms will serve as a powerful resource for indie developers, enabling them to realize their creative visions through Solana's unparalleled speed and efficiency. By tapping into the fastest settlements and lowest fees that technology can offer, developers can bring their dreams to life, resulting in captivating player experiences that resonate with their communities.
