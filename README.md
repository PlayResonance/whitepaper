## Project TLDR

[Resonance](https://playresonance.com/) is an extraordinary open-world metaverse puzzle RPG, intricately crafted on [Portals](https://theportal.to/).

Within this immersive world, AI NPCs will further enrich the player's journey, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving environment that responds to their actions and choices. What's even more exciting is the potential to create collectible assets that hold real-world value and are tradable on secondary markets, all while ensuring creators receive their well-deserved royalties. This seamless, friction-free environment is poised to spark a gaming and open-source renaissance, ushering in a new era of innovation.

At Resonance, we're dedicated to empowering our community members to fully embrace these game-changing tools and Solana's unique play-to-earn mechanics, fostering dynamic relationships between businesses and the community that drive mutual success.

The tools we're crafting for Resonance hold a unique promise. These open-source mechanisms will serve as a powerful resource for indie developers, enabling them to realize their creative visions through Solana's unparalleled speed and efficiency. By tapping into the fastest settlements and lowest fees that technology can offer, developers can bring their dreams to life, resulting in captivating player experiences that resonate with their communities.

## Resonance Gaming Ecosystem and ResonanceDAO

The Resonance Gaming Ecosystem is governed by ResonanceDAO, an autonomous decentralized organization managed by the Resonance Council, which acts as the governing body. This decentralized approach ensures that key decisions are made collectively and transparently by the community, fostering a sense of ownership and participation.

### Funding the DAO Treasury

The DAO treasury, a crucial component of ResonanceDAO, is primarily funded through various mechanisms within the ecosystem:

1. **Token Swaps:** The treasury receives contributions from token swaps that represent in-game purchases of upgrades, assets, and collectibles. These swaps are a direct result of player engagement and economic activity within the game.

2. **Staking Fees:** A portion of the staking fees generated via in-game staking mechanisms is allocated to the treasury. This mechanism encourages users to participate in staking, thereby contributing to the treasury's growth.

### Functions of the Treasury

The DAO treasury serves several vital functions:

1. **Development Funding:** One of its primary roles is to fund and foster development efforts. This includes offering bounties for improvements to the game, development of new mini-games, enhancing ecosystem security, and other initiatives aimed at advancing the project.

2. **Emergency Reserves:** The treasury also acts as a reserve in the event of unforeseen emergencies, such as security breaches, exploits, or vulnerabilities within the ecosystem. These funds can be swiftly deployed to address and mitigate such issues.

### Community-Driven Growth

ResonanceDAO's treasury is a pivotal element in driving community-driven growth and ensuring the resilience and security of the ecosystem. It aligns with the project's commitment to transparency, decentralization, and active community participation.
