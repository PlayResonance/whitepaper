- We've made sure that all details regarding token allocation, including percentages, vesting schedules, and lock-up periods, are well-documented and transparent.

### Security:

- To guarantee the utmost security, we have subjected our smart contracts and token-related processes to rigorous third-party security audits conducted by reputable auditors.

- Additionally, we have established a dedicated security fund to promptly address any unforeseen vulnerabilities, hacks, or security threats, reinforcing the safety of our ecosystem.

### Fair Distribution:

- Our commitment to fairness is evident in our token distribution model, which strives to create an equitable allocation of tokens among early supporters, team members, and our broader community.

- We are actively implementing mechanisms to prevent centralization of tokens or voting power, ensuring that our ecosystem remains decentralized and inclusive.

### Vesting and Lock-up:
