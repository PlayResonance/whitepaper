# Xerion Cola Corp (XCC) cNFT Staking 

The Xerion Cola cNFT is a unique in-game asset that represents ownership of shares in Xerion Cola Corp within the Resonance game ecosystem. These cNFTs will have a staking mechanism, enabling players to invest in Xerion Cola Corp by staking XerionCoin, the native cryptocurrency of the game, paired with Solana, into a liquidity pool hosted on Kamino Finance.

This staking cNFT is exclusively mintable within the Resonance game environment. To acquire it, players must possess a Play Resonance Token (PRT) in their wallet and use XERION for the purchase. Xerion Cola Corp (XCC) integrates a unique real-world staking experience seamlessly into the game's dynamics. In the real world, this mechanism enables players to stake XERION/SOL and receive rewards. In the game, it is represented as purchasing 'stock' in Xerion Cola Corp, with trading fees displayed as 'Dividends.' However, it's crucial to emphasize a fourth-wall disclaimer, clearly outlining the inherent risks, exposure, potential impermanent loss, and exit strategies associated with this feature.

### Key Features:

- **Ownership Representation**: Each Xerion Cola cNFT represents a specific number of shares or ownership in Xerion Cola Corp. The more cNFTs a player owns, the larger their ownership stake in the virtual corporation.

- **Staking Mechanism**: Players can stake their XerionCoin and Solana tokens into a designated liquidity pool on Kamino Finance. This staking process effectively locks up their tokens in the pool.

- **Earning Rewards**: By staking their tokens, players become liquidity providers, and they earn rewards from trading fees generated within the liquidity pool. These fees are a result of various in-game transactions, such as trading XerionCoin for other assets or using it in the game's economy.

- **Liquidity Provision**: Staking XerionCoin and Solana into the liquidity pool helps provide liquidity to the in-game marketplace. This liquidity is essential for smooth and efficient trading within the game.

- **Risk and Reward**: Players assume a level of risk by staking their tokens. While they have the potential to earn rewards, the value of their staked tokens may fluctuate based on market conditions and trading activity.

- **Kamino Finance Integration**: Kamino Finance is the platform where the liquidity pool is hosted. It provides the infrastructure and tools necessary for staking and liquidity provision.

In summary, Xerion Cola cNFTs are a novel way for players to engage with the game's ecosystem beyond traditional gameplay. They offer a unique ownership experience, allowing players to invest in a virtual corporation and earn rewards by providing liquidity through staking. This mechanism adds depth and utility to the in-game assets, contributing to the overall gaming experience in Resonance.


## Kamino Market Making

Xerion Cola Corp cNFTs will allow players to access a unique staking platform created using Kamino, a decentralized liquidity provider on Solana. The platform will enable the staking of a XerionCoin [XERION] liquidity pair. Initially, this pair will be XERION/SOL. The selected pair will be able to be modified based on a vote for alternative XERION pairs. 

   - **Simulated Dividends:** Players will receive trading fees in their staked position, which will come with a 4th-Wall Disclaimer, indicating the risk of the exposure in the real world, safety tips, and exit strategies. The disclaimer specify that within the game, these trading fees will be viewed as “Dividends”, as if the player purchased stock in XerionCorp. This fun interactive earning opportunity will serve as an educational mechanism to encourage players to ‘DYOR’ regarding Decentralized Finance opportunities made possible by Solana. 

   - **Platform Mechanics:** The XERION/SOL pair on Kamino will be hosted by ResonanceDAO, and each player’s stake will be contributed to the position. Players will receive 98% of their earned fees, 1% returns to the Resonance Community Reserve fund, and the remaining 1% is divided among the Team and Advisors. This ensures players receive the greatest earnings possible, while continuing to support the ecosystem. 

This approach will require a unique market-making pool with the help of Kamino core developers, creating a first-of-its-kind token gated liquidity pool. This approach will create a unique relationship between players of the game and day traders.
