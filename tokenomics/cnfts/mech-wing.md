# Mech-Wing NFTs

## Overview

Mech-Wing NFTs are a vital component of the Resonance Game's top-down shooter minigame. These NFTs represent customizable in-game assets that allow players to engage in exciting battles, earn points, and strategically upgrade their gameplay experience.

In order to play the top-down shooter Mech Wing mini-game, players will need both a Play Resonance Token and Mech Wing Token. 

## Gen1 Tokens and Initial Multiplier

ResonanceDAO will mint a special Gen1 Collection for the Mech Wing tokens. These Gen1 tokens come with a unique advantageâ€”a higher earning rate. Here's what you need to know:

- **Distribution:** 50% of the Gen1 tokens will be distributed to contributors, while the remaining 50% will be listed for a Floor Price of 1 SOL.

- **Trading Dynamics:** Contributors can freely trade their Gen1 tokens in the open market. However, ResonanceDAO will not be able to list Gen1 tokens below the Floor Price of 1 SOL. This ensures stability and discourages lowering the floor price.

- **Earning Advantage:** Gen1 Tokens will have an initial multiplier, earning RPT at a rate 150% higher than standard player tokens and mech-wing tokens. This multiplier can stack with the Gen1 Mech Wing Tokens multiplier, and remains in effect indefinitely. 

Investors and contributors can leverage this initial multiplier for potential rewards and enhanced gameplay within the Resonance ecosystem, for additional spending power in the game, or greater governance power down the road.
