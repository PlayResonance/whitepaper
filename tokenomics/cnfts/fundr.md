**Description:**
The Contributor Tokens, denoted as FUNDR, mark the initial Resonance Game Tokens available for minting. These tokens have a capped supply of 100, and each one can be obtained at a cost of $1000, requiring payment in SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain.

**Allocation and Rewards:**
Every Contributor Token represents a valuable stake in the ResonanceDAO ecosystem. Holders of FUNDR tokens are entitled to receive a share of 1% from the total allocation of rewards emitted by the ResonanceDAO Treasury designated for Contributors. This allocation aims to reward and recognize the invaluable contributions made by those holding FUNDR tokens.

This revenue allocation is part of the broader strategy to ensure that Contributors are appropriately rewarded for their active involvement and contributions to the project's success.

**Governance and Participation:**
Contributors, being integral to the project's development and direction, will receive an airdrop of a designated allocation of RESON tokens. This airdrop is intended to incentivize their active engagement in the governance processes of the ResonanceDAO. Through their participation in governance, Contributors have a direct say in critical decisions, proposals, and initiatives that shape the future of the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem.

The FUNDR tokens are a unique opportunity for early contributors to become actively engaged stakeholders in the project, aligning their interests with the long-term success and growth of Resonance.
