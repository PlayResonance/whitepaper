## Play Resonance Token (PRT)

The Play Resonance Token (PRT) is a fundamental in-game asset within the Resonance ecosystem, designed to empower players and enhance their gaming experience. PRTs serve as the key to accessing and enjoying the Resonance Game.

### Key Features:

- **Required for Gameplay**: To participate in the Resonance Game, players need to possess and use PRTs. These tokens grant access to the game environment, where players can embark on adventures, complete challenges, and interact with the virtual world.

- **Points and Level Data**: PRTs store essential data related to a player's progress in the game, including their Points and Level. As players engage with the game, their PRT accumulates Points, reflecting their in-game achievements and accomplishments.

- **Low Minting Cost**: Minting a PRT costs a minimal fee of 0.1 SOL, making it accessible for players of all levels. This affordability encourages broader participation in the game.

- **Initial Distribution**: To kickstart the ecosystem, a collection of 1,000 PRTs will be minted and distributed to contributors during the project's launch phase. These initial PRTs can be used by players to access the game, upgrade their characters, and even list them on secondary markets.

- **No Capped Supply**: Unlike some tokens, PRTs do not have a capped supply. This means that players have the flexibility to mint, hold, or list as many tokens as they desire, enabling a dynamic and evolving player-driven ecosystem.

- **Secondary Market Trading**: PRTs can be listed on secondary markets, allowing players to trade and exchange them with others. This feature creates a fluid and self-sustaining economy where newcomers can acquire PRTs without the need for extensive token expenditures.

The Player Resonance Token is at the core of the Resonance Game, ensuring that players have easy access to the game world while also allowing them to showcase their achievements through the Points and Level data stored within their tokens. With an open supply and low minting cost, PRTs encourage widespread participation and foster a vibrant and engaging gaming ecosystem.

## Gen1 Tokens and Initial Multiplier

ResonanceDAO will mint a special Gen1 Collection for the Play Resonance tokens. These Gen1 tokens come with a unique advantageâ€”a higher earning rate. Here's what you need to know:

- **Distribution:** 50% of the Gen1 tokens will be distributed to contributors, while the remaining 50% will be listed for a Floor Price of 1 SOL.

- **Trading Dynamics:** Contributors can freely trade their Gen1 tokens in the open market. However, ResonanceDAO will not be able to list Gen1 tokens below the Floor Price of 1 SOL. This ensures stability and discourages lowering the floor price.

- **Earning Advantage:** Gen1 Tokens will have an initial multiplier, earning RPT and XERION at a rate 150% higher than standard player tokens and mech-wing tokens. This multiplier can stack with the Gen1 Mech Wing Tokens multiplier, and remains in effect indefinitely. 

Investors and contributors can leverage this initial multiplier for potential rewards and enhanced gameplay within the Resonance ecosystem.
