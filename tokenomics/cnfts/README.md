## Contributor Token (FUNDR)

Contributor Tokens are the initial tokens available for minting in the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem. With a capped supply of 100 tokens and a price of $1000 per token (payable in SOL), FUNDR tokens reward contributors with 1% of the ResonanceDAO Treasury emissions. As active participants in governance, Contributors also receive RESON token airdrops to encourage their continued involvement in shaping the project's future. FUNDR tokens represent a unique opportunity for early contributors to become valued stakeholders in Resonance's success.

## Play Resonance Token (PRT)

PRT is your passport to the Resonance Game, granting access, tracking progress, and enhancing gameplay. This token contains the points data, unique character info such as level and appearance, and ethics class, which impacts dialog options.


## Xerion Cola Corp Token

**Xerion Cola Corp (XCC) cNFTs** represent a unique opportunity for players to stake their XerionCoin (XERION) and Solana (SOL) into a Kamino position within the game. By staking XERION and SOL, players invest in Xerion Cola Corporation, a lore element of the game, and earn staking rewards.

### Key Features:
- **Investment in Lore:** Staking XERION and SOL via XCC cNFTs aligns with the game's lore, where players become investors in the fictional Xerion Cola Corporation.

## Upgradeable Mech-Wing Token

**Mech-Wing cNFTs** are in-game assets required to play the top-down shooter minigame within Resonance. Players spawn the Mech-Wing NFT to begin the game, gain points for destroying enemies, and use these points to upgrade their Mech-Wing. Upgrades modify the metadata of the cNFT, enhancing firepower, weapons, defense, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Enhanced Gameplay:** Mech-Wing cNFTs significantly impact the top-down shooter minigame by allowing players to customize their gameplay experience through upgrades.

## Royalties

Within the Resonance gaming ecosystem, all semi-fungible (SFTs), compressed non-fungible (cNFTs), programmable NFTs (pNFTs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will have royalties enforced. These royalties ensure that creators and contributors continue to benefit from the ecosystem's growth. Here's how they work:

- **Royalty Percentage:** 3% of the transaction value for these tokens will be allocated as royalties.

- **Team and Advisors:** 1.5% of the royalties collected will be directed to the Team and Advisors as recognition for their contributions and involvement in the project.

- **Community Reserve Fund:** The remaining 1.5% of the royalties will be added to the Community Reserve Fund. This fund serves as a valuable resource to support community initiatives, development, and other activities that benefit the broader ecosystem.

These royalties promote sustainability, incentivize creators, and contribute to the ongoing growth and prosperity of the Resonance gaming ecosystem.
