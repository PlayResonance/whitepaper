# Roles

Within the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem, there are several distinct roles that shape the evolution of the game and contribute to its vibrant community. This unique structure empowers players to actively participate in the game's growth, fostering a long-term sandbox effect. Players can contribute to the lore, create new minigames, establish real-world economies through activities such as staking, real estate rental, and asset swapping, among others.

**Resonance DAO Governance Transition:** The governance of Resonance DAO will initially be managed by the Resonance Council. However, once we reach 10,000 active players, the Council will initiate a vote to transition to community governance. In this new model, governance decisions will be weighted by RESON tokens, which can be staked to ResonanceDAO to increase voting power. Ultimately, the future of Resonance will be shaped by the collective input of players and voting community members.

## Economy and Revenue

The revenue streams from within the game all flow toward the DAO treasury. They come from various sources, such as asset swapping, trading, staking fees, and more. We will refer to all income to the treausry as 'Revenue'. A percentage of Revenue will be divided among the roles, creating a passive earning ecosystem with a recycling effect. 

The Revenue is allocated as follows-

- **Creator:** *x*%
- **Team:** *y*%
- **Council:** *z*%
- **Advisor:** *a*%
- **Contributor:** *b*%
- **Player:** *c*%
- *There is no accurate way to account Community participation- community members who wish to participate in earning must play a role in the ecosystem.*
