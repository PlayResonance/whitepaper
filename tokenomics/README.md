The Resonance Gaming Ecosystem consists of four key tokens, each serving a distinct purpose within the gaming environment. These tokens work together to create a dynamic and engaging gaming experience for players while offering opportunities for governance and investment. Here's a brief overview of the interrelationship between these tokens:

1. **[XerionCoin (XERION)](https://github.com/PlayResonance/whitepaper/blob/main/tokenomics/xerioncoin.md)**

3. **[Resonance Council Token (RCT)](https://github.com/PlayResonance/whitepaper/blob/main/tokenomics/rct.md)**
   - Token Type: SPL Token
   - Role: Council Membership
   - Functionality:
     - Grants membership to the ResonanceDAO council, governing the DAO until a community of 10,000 players is established.
     - Provides voting capability in DAO governance decisions.

4. **[Resonance (RESON)](https://github.com/PlayResonance/whitepaper/blob/main/tokenomics/reson.md)**
   - Token Type: SPL Token
   - Role: Community Governance
   - Functionality:
     - Represents community governance within the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem.
     - Acquired using RPT or XERION through a DAO treasury swap.
     - Used for participating in governance decisions and shaping the ecosystem's future.
   - Connection to XerionCoin (XERION):
     - XERION can be used to acquire RESON tokens, enabling players to have a say in ecosystem governance.

## Token Interaction

- [Pre-10,000] Until there are 10,000 players, governance will be overseen by the ResonanceDAO Council.
- [Post-10,000] After Resonance crosses 10,000 active players, we will iniate a vote to swap to community governance.
- RPT will be required for in-game upgrades to the Play Resonance Token [PRT], which can be listed on secondary in compete with costs incurred from RPT-upgrades to create an in-game economy between new and existing players, allowing newcomers to acquire upgrades at potentially lower costs.
- XERION is the primary asset for purchasing goods in-game, such as furniture, real estate, clothing etc. It can be staked with SOL by players with the Xerion Cola Corp (XCC), introducing an investment element to the gaming experience. 
- RESON holders will eventually have a governance role in shaping the ecosystem's decisions, including those related to RESON token utility and distribution.

## Token Availability  

   - **In-Game Earning:**
Players can earn the XERION coin by performing jobs in the Resonance universe. Points tokens are awarded in accordance with the points scale system of a given mini-game.

   - **Open Market:**
A specified percentage of each token will be made availble to trade on open markets via liquidity pools provided by ResonanceDAO through Kamino Finance. 

   - **Treasury Swaps:**
The Resonance Gaming Ecosystem is committed to fostering community participation and governance. To facilitate this, we have established a DAO treasury that allows players to swap their tokens for RESON, the token representing community governance within the ecosystem, at specified rates. These swaps are designed to encourage player involvement in shaping the ecosystem's future. 

<i>The Resonance Council will be the absolute governing body until we have 10,000 active players.</i>

### DAO Treasury Swaps
   - **RPT to RESON Swap:** Players can swap Resonance Points Tokens (RPT) for RESON at a rate of 3:1. This means for every 3 RPT tokens swapped, you will receive 1 RESON token. This mechanism allows players to convert their in-game reward points into governance tokens, enabling them to actively participate in the decision-making process of the ecosystem.

   - **XerionCoin to RESON Swap:** Additionally, XerionCoin (XERION) holders can participate in governance by swapping their tokens for RESON at a rate of 4:1. For every 4 XERION tokens swapped, you will receive 1 RESON token. This provides an avenue for those who hold XERION to become actively involved in the governance structure.

These treasury swaps are part of our commitment to decentralization and community-driven decision-making. They ensure that players have a direct stake in the ecosystem's governance when community governance is implemented, fostering a sense of ownership and participation.

The rates for these swaps are designed to provide accessibility to governance participation while maintaining a balance that reflects the value of each token within the ecosystem. As the ecosystem evolves and governance decisions are made, the swap rates may be subject to adjustments to align with the community's interests and the ecosystem's growth.

We encourage players to stay engaged with the ecosystem, participate in governance discussions, and take advantage of these treasury swaps to actively shape the future of the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem. Your voice and involvement are integral to our ongoing development and success.

## cNFTs

Various in game assets will be represented by compressed NFTs with updatable metadata. These assets will allow players to fully customize their in-game experience, and take ownership of their character and belongings in the game like never before. These assets will rest in the player's wallet and available to list on secondary markets. 

[Here](https://github.com/PlayResonance/whitepaper/tree/main/tokenomics/cnfts) are the cNFTs we are developing. We are excited to share more as they become available.

## Roadmap and Development

The Resonance Gaming Ecosystem is continually evolving, with ongoing development and improvements to enhance gameplay, governance, and investment opportunities. Community feedback and engagement are pivotal in driving the ecosystem's growth and ensuring an exciting gaming experience.
