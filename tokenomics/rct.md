# Resonance Council Token (RCT)

**Token Name:** Resonance Council Token (RCT)  
**Token Symbol:** RCT  
**Token Type:** SPL Token (Solana Token)  
**Mint Authority Status:** Controlled by a smart contract.

## Token Purpose:
The Resonance Council Token (RCT) serves as a membership token for the ResonanceDAO council within the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem. Unlike traditional tokens, RCT does not have a transferable value, and it is not available for sale or exchange. Instead, it represents an individual's membership in the council and their voting capability in DAO governance.

## Token Allocation:
There is no traditional token allocation for RCT since it is not created, distributed, or sold like other tokens. Instead, a new RCT is minted when a new member is added to the ResonanceDAO council.

## Token Utility:
- **Membership in ResonanceDAO Council:** RCT holders are granted membership in the ResonanceDAO council, enabling them to participate in key governance decisions, proposals, and voting.
- **Governance Participation:** RCT is primarily used for active participation in DAO governance, including voting on proposals related to the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem's development.
- **Non-Transferable:** RCT is not transferable between users or tradable on the open market. It remains associated with the council member's wallet.
- **Non-Monetary Value:** RCT does not have a monetary value; its value lies in its role as a governance token within the ResonanceDAO council.

## Governance and Decision-Making:
- **DAO Structure:** The ResonanceDAO is the governing body of the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem, and RCT holders are council members.
- **Voting Rights:** RCT holders, as council members, have the right to vote on proposals, initiatives, and decisions related to the game's development, ecosystem, and governance.
- **Council Composition:** The council may consist of active and engaged community members selected based on various criteria. New members receive an RCT to participate in governance.

## Token Value:
RCT does not have a traditional market value or a circulating supply. Its value is intrinsic to the governance and decision-making power it grants to council members within the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem.

## Security Measures:
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Smart contracts related to RCT and DAO governance undergo third-party security audits to ensure the safety and integrity of the ecosystem.
- **Security Fund Allocation:** A security fund may be allocated to address potential vulnerabilities and protect the council's interests.

## Token Distribution and Vesting:
There is no predefined token distribution, vesting schedules, or lock-up periods for RCT since it is minted upon adding new members to the ResonanceDAO council.

## Tokenomics Evolution and Updates:
The tokenomics of RCT can evolve over time based on community feedback and requirements as the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem project develops. Community members can provide input on potential changes to RCT's role within the DAO.

## Miscellaneous:
RCT plays a crucial role in the governance of the Resonance Gaming Ecosystem, allowing council members to actively shape the project's future, make important decisions, and drive ecosystem growth. It is not intended for financial transactions or speculative trading.
